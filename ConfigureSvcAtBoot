For simple startup service management on Raspberry Pi I recommend tool rcconf. It allows you to easily turn on/off services in /etc/init.d/. You can also see if they are enabled and will run at startup.

To install the tool

sudo apt-get install rcconf

And is very simple to use it with text UI

sudo rcconf
